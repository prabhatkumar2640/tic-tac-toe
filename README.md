# Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game written in JavaScript. It provides a two-player mode where players take turns marking their symbol (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
